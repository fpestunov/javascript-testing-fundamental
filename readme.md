# JavaScript Testing Fundamentals

## Why is testing important?
1. Confidence (уверенность) of your code
2. Documentation for developers
3. Refactoring gets easy
4. Become a better developer
5. Working in a team

## What to test?
We're going to learn how to evaluate our code and identify what we should test. We walk through a User class and evaluate each method.

## Types of Testing
In this lesson about testing, we're learning about the different types of tests we can create.
