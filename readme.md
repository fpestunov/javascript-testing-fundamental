# JavaScript Testing Fundamentals

## Why is testing important?
1. Confidence (уверенность) of your code
2. Documentation for developers
3. Refactoring gets easy
4. Become a better developer
5. Working in a team

## What to test?
We're going to learn how to evaluate our code and identify what we should test. We walk through a User class and evaluate each method.

## Types of Testing
In this lesson about testing, we're learning about the different types of tests we can create.

```
    /1\      -  SLOW
  /  2  \
/____3____\  -  FAST
```

1. Acceptance Tests (often called end-to-end tests)
2. Integration Tests
3. Unit Tests - тестирование маленьких кусочков кода

Lets make first Unit test for class `User`.

## What are mocks and mocking?
Mocks are a common tool when writing tests for your software. In this lesson, we're learning what mocks are and why and when they are useful.

If we talk of a Mock, we mean an alternate implementation of a Dependency, when we are testing our code.

Here is mock example `mocks.js`.
